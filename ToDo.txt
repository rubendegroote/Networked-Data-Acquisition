Highest priority:
None!

High priority:
1. Logbook (GUI): add the functionality to look at older data from the logbook
    - Implement file server to send h5 files
        - Locally save h5 files and convert to csv in background
    - Plot the data on a canvas
        - Add one plot to the log viewer GUI that can be used to overlay multiple older measurements
        - Add a checkbox to the logbook entry if you want it plotted
        - Add options to plot them separately or to combine the statistics into one plot (+ save as csv/h5 feature? This is lower priority.)
2. GUI launcher for ARTIST/Data Server/Manager/Logbook/Radio configuration - in case we are not there ;)
3. Radio: Radio should transmit how much data it has, so the data server doesn't need to send it all each time.
4. Manager: set hard limits on parameters for setting to say in the safe zone (eg. no ridiculously high voltage because of an accidental switch from laser wavelength, no ridiculously small wavelength because of an accidental switch from voltage)
5. Logbook viewer: Retrieve the data for a requested scan from the dataserver, save it locally and display it. If it is already saved locally, don't retrieve it.

Medium priority:
1. Write help/user documentation
2. Network hiccup thingie solving

Low priority:
1. Manager (GUI): add the option to ask the user for input for every setpoint of the scan. So, wait for a user-upplied setpoint every time
