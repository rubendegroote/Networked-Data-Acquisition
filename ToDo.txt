To Do


High priority:
1. Manager (GUI): add the option to just send one setpoint to the scanning computer (not as part of a scan) 
2. Logbook (GUI): add the functionality to look at older data from the logbook
    - Implement file server to send h5 files
        - Locally save h5 files and convert to csv in background
    - Plot the data on a canvas
        - Add one plot to the log viewer GUI that can be used to overlay multiple older measurements
        - Add a checkbox to the logbook entry if you want it plotted
        - Add options to plot them separately or to combine the statistics into one plot (+ save as csv/h5 feature? This is lower priority.)
3. Logbook (GUI): add search functionality
    - Search particular fields for particular string snippets
4. Logbook (GUI): add tags ('boolean' properties - either you have this tag, or you don't)
    - e.g. 'Left multiplet', 'Brol', etc.
    - Should also be included in the search functionality
5. GUI launcher for ARTIST/Data Server/Manager/Logbook configuration - in case we are not there ;)

Medium priority:
1. Radio (GUI): Multiple data streams. Two options here: one is to just launch several radios, the other is to add multiple plots to one radio. I prefer the former.
    - Implement a Radio launcher app to make this easier (very simple GUI that remembers the PORT/IP of the dataserver and launches a connected radio with 1 click of a button)
2. Write help/user documentation 

Low priority:
1. Manager (GUI): add the option to ask the user for input for every setpoint of the scan. So, wait for a user-upplied setpoint every time
